## Project grade: 20/20

## Proposed problem

The problem proposed for this project was for us to build a tool to aid in the choice of route between 2 locations on a bus network (based on real data), using for that a graph data structure. The project specification got deeper in explaining the intended features to implement (defining "locations" as a network node/coordinate pair, various definitions of "best-route", etc...). Of those, the only one that was not achieved was the **"best route using the least bus line changes"**.

This is due to the fact that the dataset given to us, being processed "as is" (just like we did), creates a multi-graph, which in turn makes it impossible to discover the **"best route using the least bus line changes"**, since this would require analysis of every outwards edge on every node along the path between the 2 chosen points, which would not only waste a lot of memory but is also absurdly time-consuming. A solution to this problem is not to store each "real-world" node as a graph node but every "node/edge-identifier" pair as the node. This way one would lose the multi-graph, allowing to more efficiently traverse the desired nodes.

Despite this, we have implemented features that were marked as "extra credits".
